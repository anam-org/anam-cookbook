# Anam Cookbook

Example code and guides for building conversational AI experiences with [Anam](https://anam.ai) avatars.

Browse the cookbook at **[anam.ai/cookbook](https://anam.ai/cookbook)** or read the guides below.

## Getting started

To use the Anam SDK, you'll need an API key from [lab.anam.ai](https://lab.anam.ai).

Most examples are written in JavaScript/TypeScript using the `@anam-ai/js-sdk` package:

```bash
npm install @anam-ai/js-sdk
```

## Example code

Some cookbook articles include working examples in the [`examples/`](examples/) directory.
