# Adding the Anam widget to Squarespace

The Anam widget is a drop-in web component that adds a conversational AI avatar to any website. On Squarespace, getting it running is a two-minute job. You paste two lines of HTML into the code injection panel, and your persona shows up on every page.

## What you'll build

A Squarespace site with an Anam avatar widget. Visitors can click it to start a conversation with your AI persona.

## Prerequisites

- An Anam account with a published persona ([lab.anam.ai](https://lab.anam.ai))
- A Squarespace site on a Core plan or higher

<Info>
Code injection is not available on Squarespace's free trial. You'll need at least a Core plan.
</Info>

## Grab your embed code

Head to [Anam Lab](https://lab.anam.ai) and open the persona you want to deploy. Go to the **Widget** tab and copy the embed snippet. It looks like this:

```html
<anam-agent agent-id="your-persona-id"></anam-agent>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@anam-ai/agent-widget" async></script>
```

## Open code injection in Squarespace

From your Squarespace dashboard, click **Website** in the left sidebar to expand the menu.

Now go to **Website → Pages**. At the bottom of the pages panel you'll see **Custom Code → Code Injection**.

## Paste the embed code

Drop your two lines into the **Header** code injection field. That's it.

Click **Save** and you're done with the configuration.

## Check it on your live site

Open your live site URL and you should see the widget on the page.

## Customizing the widget

The easiest way to customize your widget is through the [Anam Lab](https://lab.anam.ai) interface. Open your persona's **Widget** tab to change the layout, position, initial state, call-to-action text, and more. You don't need to re-copy the embed code after making changes. Just hit **Publish** in the Anam Lab and your live widget will update automatically.

You can also override settings per-embed using HTML attributes. For example, if you want a specific page to behave differently from your Lab defaults:

```html
<anam-agent
  agent-id="your-persona-id"
  initial-state="minimized"
  call-to-action="Chat with us"
></anam-agent>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@anam-ai/agent-widget" async></script>
```

The full list of attributes is in the [widget documentation](https://docs.anam.ai/widget/overview).

## Removing the widget

To take the widget down, go back to the code injection panel and delete the two lines you added. Save, and it's gone from your site.
